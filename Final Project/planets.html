                    <h3>Mercury</h3>
                    <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and has extreme temperature variations, with a day lasting 176 Earth days. It has no atmosphere to retain heat.</p>
                    <strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> 57.9 million km
                </li>
                <li class="planet">
                    <h3>Venus</h3>
                    <p>Venus is known for its thick atmosphere, which creates a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system. It rotates backwards compared to other planets.</p>
                    <strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> 108.2 million km
                </li>
                <li class="planet">
                    <h3>Earth</h3>
                    <p>Our home planet, Earth, is the only known planet to support life. It has a perfect mix of atmosphere, water, and temperature to sustain life.</p>
                    <strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> 149.6 million km
                </li>
                <li class="planet">
                    <h3>Mars</h3>
                    <p>Mars, known as the Red Planet, has been the subject of human interest for potential colonization. It has a thin atmosphere and seasonal dust storms.</p>
                    <strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> 227.9 million km
                </li>
                <li class="planet">
                    <h3>Jupiter</h3>
                    <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, a gas giant with a strong magnetic field and famous for its Great Red Spot, a giant storm that has lasted for centuries.</p>
                    <strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> 778.3 million km
                </li>
                <li class="planet">
                    <h3>Saturn</h3>
                    <p>Saturn is known for its iconic ring system, which is made of ice and rock particles. It’s the second-largest planet in our solar system.</p>
                    <strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> 1.43 billion km
                </li>
                <li class="planet">
                    <h3>Uranus</h3>
                    <p>Uranus is a gas giant that rotates on its side, making its axis of rotation almost parallel to its orbit. It’s often called an “ice giant” due to its cold atmosphere.</p>
                    <strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> 2.87 billion km
                </li>
                <li class="planet">
                    <h3>Neptune</h3>
                    <p>Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun and has the strongest winds in the solar system. Its atmosphere is mostly composed of hydrogen, helium, and methane.</p>
                    <strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> 4.5 billion km

            <h2>Planets Beyond Our Solar System</h2>
            <p>Exoplanets, or planets outside our solar system, are being discovered regularly. Scientists have found thousands of them, and many are in the habitable zone of their stars.</p>
            <ul class="planets-list">
                <li class="planet">
                    <h3>Kepler-452b</h3>
                    <p>Kepler-452b, also known as Earth’s cousin, is an exoplanet that orbits in the habitable zone of its star. It's the most Earth-like planet discovered so far.</p>
                    <strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 1,400 light-years
                </li>
                <li class="planet">
                    <h3>Proxima Centauri b</h3>
                    <p>Proxima Centauri b orbits the closest star to our Sun, Proxima Centauri. It’s located in the habitable zone, making it a potential candidate for life.</p>
                    <strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 4.24 light-years
                </li>
                <li class="planet">
                    <h3>TRAPPIST-1</h3>
                    <p>TRAPPIST-1 is a star system with seven Earth-sized planets, three of which are in the habitable zone, potentially able to support life.</p>
                    <strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> 39.5 light-years
